//BONUS

create processes with fork

if a child exits with an error (philo died), kill all other child processes

monitor can still be a thread? one for each philo?

create a semaphore with sem_open

value of semaphore = amount of philos, increment with sem_post

also one general semaphore for writing and other stuff?

each philo when taking a fork decrements semaphore with sem_wait
